# ast596fds-final
Final group project for Frank Fu, Sihan Li, Jennifer Li, Chris Tandoi

# Project proposal:
Astrophysical dataset that we find interesting. Project must satisfy (at least) two of:

	- time-series analysis
    - hierarchical Bayesian modeling
    - dealing with selection effects in data when building models
    - machine learning	
	
# Statement of work:
How do we want to accomplish this? Think about final outcome, work backwards on how to get there. What is needed at each step? Work will be done in Jupyter notebooks.

# Tasks:

## Frank Fu

## Sihan Li

## Jennifer Li

## Chris Tandoi
